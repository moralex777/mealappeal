# Deployment Verification - OpenAI Improvements

**Deployment Time**: June 17, 2025 - 3:08 PM
**Commit**: d995591

## ðŸš€ Deployment Status
- [x] Code pushed to main branch
- [ ] Vercel deployment complete (check dashboard)
- [ ] Production API responding

## ðŸ“‹ Verification Checklist

### 1. Check Production API
```bash
curl https://www.mealappeal.app/api/health
```

### 2. Test Meal Analysis
- Analyze a pizza photo
- Check response metadata for:
  ```json
  "metadata": {
    "seed": 42,
    "temperature": 0.3
  }
  ```

### 3. Verify Cache Behavior
- Analyze same meal twice
- Second request should show `"cached": true`
- Common foods should cache for 30 minutes

### 4. Monitor Logs
Look for in production logs:
- "Returning cached analysis (extended cache)" - for common foods
- "Returning cached analysis (standard cache)" - for other foods

## ðŸ“Š Metrics to Track (First 48 Hours)

1. **Cache Hit Rate**
   - Baseline: ~5%
   - Target: >20% for common foods

2. **API Costs**
   - Monitor OpenAI dashboard
   - Should see 20-30% reduction

3. **Response Consistency**
   - Same meal = same nutrition data
   - User complaints about inconsistency should drop

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria
- [ ] No errors in production
- [ ] Cache working for common foods
- [ ] API costs trending down
- [ ] Consistent results for same meals

## ðŸ”„ Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
```bash
git revert d995591
git push origin main
```
