# Future Features - Archived for Later

This directory contains features that have been developed but are not currently needed. They are saved here for future implementation when MealAppeal scales.

## MCP Servers (Model Context Protocol)

**Status**: Fully implemented but not deployed
**When to use**: When MealAppeal reaches 100+ paying users or $5K+ MRR

### What's Included:
- 8 MCP servers for production monitoring and management
- Security & Compliance automation (GDPR, auditing)
- Automated backup and disaster recovery
- Production monitoring and alerting
- API cost management
- Revenue analytics
- User behavior tracking
- Customer support automation

### Why Archived:
- Overkill for 20 users
- Adds unnecessary complexity
- Time better spent on core features and revenue
- Can be deployed later when actually needed

### To Deploy Later:
1. Move `mcp-servers/` back to project root
2. Move `mcp.json` back to project root
3. Run the database migration: `supabase/migrations/20250617_create_mcp_tables.sql`
4. Update package.json with MCP scripts
5. Run `npm run mcp:start`

### Current Alternative:
Using simple monitoring approach:
- Vercel Analytics (built-in)
- UptimeRobot (free tier)
- Sentry error tracking
- Stripe Dashboard
- Simple admin dashboard

Remember: Don't over-engineer. Focus on getting to 100 paying users first!
