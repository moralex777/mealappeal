# MealAppeal Upgrade Page Fixes

## Issue
The `/upgrade` page was showing only a gradient background instead of the pricing options ($4.99/month and $49.99/year). Users couldn't see or purchase premium plans.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Emergency CSS Hiding Key Elements
**File:** `src/app/emergency-fix.css`
**Problem:** The `.from-brand-50` Tailwind class was being hidden with `display: none !important`
**Impact:** The main container of the upgrade page was completely hidden

**Fix Applied:**
```css
/* BEFORE */
.from-brand-50,
.container,
.gradient-text,
.gradient-brand {
  display: none !important;
}

/* AFTER */
.container,
.gradient-text,
.gradient-brand {
  display: none !important;
}
```

### 2. Global Background Override
**File:** `src/app/layout.tsx`
**Problem:** Global rainbow gradient background with `!important` was preventing page-specific backgrounds
**Impact:** Individual pages couldn't set their own background styling

**Fix Applied:**
```css
/* BEFORE */
html, body {
  background: linear-gradient(...) !important;
  min-height: 100vh !important;
}

/* AFTER */
html {
  background: linear-gradient(...);
  min-height: 100vh;
}
body {
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```
