### Post-Launch Fixes (June 15, 2025):
1. **Profile Creation Issue** (FIXED ✅)
   - Problem: New users couldn't login - "Error Loading Account, no profile data found"
   - Cause: Database trigger using wrong column names (id vs user_id)
   - Solution: Fixed trigger and created profiles for existing users
   - Files: `fix-registration-trigger.sql`, `fix-missing-profiles.sql`

2. **Camera Permissions Issue** (FIXED ✅)
   - Problem: Camera not working on production site
   - Cause: Permissions-Policy header blocking camera access
   - Solution: Updated vercel.json to allow camera for www.mealappeal.app
   - Deployment: Fixed in vercel.json headers configuration

3. **Image Analysis API Error** (FIXED ✅)
   - Problem: "Failed to process image. Please try again"
   - Cause: Camera sending invalid focusMode 'health_wellness' instead of 'health'
   - Solution: Fixed parameter validation in camera page
   - Valid modes: 'health', 'fitness', 'cultural', 'chef', 'science', 'budget'

### Critical Production Learnings:
- Vercel serverless can't write log files - use console logging only
- Database triggers must match exact column names in profiles table
- Camera permissions require explicit domain allowlist in headers
- API parameter validation must match between frontend and backend

This marks the beginning of MealAppeal's journey to help millions eat healthier! 🌱
