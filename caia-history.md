---

## 🚨 EMERGENCY FIX TEMPLATES

### Critical Dropdown Styling Fix

**Problem:** Dropdown elements rendered with `background-color: buttonface` (browser default)
**Root Cause:** Button elements within dropdowns inheriting browser default styling
**Solution Pattern:**

```css
/* Target all dropdown button elements */
[data-slot='popover-content'] button,
[data-slot='select-content'] button,
[data-slot='dropdown-menu-content'] button {
  background-color: white !important;
  background: white !important;
  border: none !important;
}

/* Calendar-specific fixes */
.rdp-caption_dropdowns button,
.rdp button,
.rdp-nav button,
.rdp-day button {
  background-color: white !important;
  background: white !important;
  border: 1px solid #e5e7eb !important;
}
```

### CSS Compilation Error Fix

**Problem:** `Cannot apply unknown utility class 'border-border'`
**Solution:** Replace with standard Tailwind classes

```css
/* From: */
* {
  @apply border-border;
}
/* To: */
* {
  @apply border-gray-200;
}
```

---

## 🎨 DESIGN SYSTEM RESTORATION

### Glass Morphism Component System

**Use Case:** Beautiful, Instagram-worthy UI components
**Implementation Pattern:**

```css
.glass-card {
  @apply border border-white/20 bg-white/80 shadow-xl backdrop-blur-xl;
}

.glass-card-strong {
  @apply border border-white/30 bg-white/90 shadow-2xl backdrop-blur-xl;
}
```

### Food-Focused Gradient System

```css
.gradient-text {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #16a34a 0%, #ea580c 100%);
  background-clip: text;
  -webkit-background-clip: text;
  color: transparent;
}

.gradient-appetite {
  background: linear-gradient(
    135deg,
    hsl(var(--appetite-orange)) 0%,
    hsl(var(--appetite-red)) 50%,
    hsl(var(--appetite-purple)) 100%
  );
}
```
